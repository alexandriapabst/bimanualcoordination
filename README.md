# bimanualcoordination
Data from a bimanual coordination task were collected from a KINARM robotic exoskeleton. In this task, participants were asked to reach toward two circular objects using their arms, and while they reached, forces could be applied to the hand. The forces varied in strength, and were either elastic or viscous loads. Additionally, the objects varied in distance. The data are recorded from the hand, the elbow, and the shoulder positions of the arm at 4000Hz, and were downsampled from the robot computer to 1000Hz. The KINARM robot computer also automatically calculates velocity and acceleration to account for visual lag and the downsampling process.
